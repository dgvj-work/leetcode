"""
if there is 3 consecutive 0s ie at i, i+1 and i-1 means we can plant the 1 at i. 
also there will be an edge case that is [0,0,1,1] it has only two consecutive 0s but we still can plant 1 at the starting position.
So we will add 0s at start and end and check for all the given values in array. For detail explanation check out neetcode solution video.
